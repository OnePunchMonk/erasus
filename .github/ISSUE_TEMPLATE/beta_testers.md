## We're looking for beta testers!

Erasus supports machine unlearning across Vision-Language Models, LLMs, Diffusion, Audio, and Video. We'd love to hear about your use case.

**Reply with:**
1. Your model type (e.g., GPT-2, LLaMA, CLIP, Stable Diffusion)
2. What you want to unlearn (e.g., copyrighted data, PII, harmful knowledge)
3. Any constraints (compute, time, accuracy requirements)

**What we offer:**
- Early access to new features
- Direct support from the maintainers
- Your feedback will shape the roadmap

See the [demo notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/OnePunchMonk/erasus/blob/main/notebooks/demo_remove_harry_potter_from_gpt2.ipynb) to try it in 5 minutes.
